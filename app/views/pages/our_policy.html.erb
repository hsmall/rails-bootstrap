<h1>Our Policy Recommendation</h1>
	
<p>We recognize that there is extrordinary value in being able to better maintain the security of school children nationwide, but we also recognize that students deserve a baseline level of privacy that does not include continous tracking. To satisfy the interests of schools and privacy activists, we will propose here a &quot;most-invasive&quot; implementation. That is, the implementation described is as invasive (most weighted towards the interests of the school) as we would like to see. This will define our deontological standpoint on the morally acceptable limit for student tracking.</p>

<p>In our implementation, students are given active RFID-style trackers that are only capable of transmitting when specifically, temporarily, and clearly activated by the student, giving the student full control over when tracking is enabled and when it is not. When disabled, it should be impossible for any system to read data from the device (this could be a simple power switch, a detuning of the RFID antenna, or any similar strategy). These devices would likely be integrated into the students’ ID cards.</p>

<p>Since the interests of the schools only rely on student locations at specific times (during roll call or an emergency situation) or for a specific reason (to pay for something at lunch), the tracker need only be activated for those purposes. When desired, tracker activation could be requested by teachers individually or over the PA system. By preventing location data from even existing at other times, this system significantly reduces the concerns of privacy activists.</p>

<p>The above system would likely prove appropriate for the vast majority of students. A few special cases, however, may exist. Students objecting on religious grounds would not be given wirelessly enabled ID cards, which has proven to be a complete legal redress. In this case, we take a utilitarian viewpoint by saying that the small loss in efficiency or money to the school is outweighed by the individual student’s loss of freedom. Students with special needs, are deemed at risk of wandering, and are otherwise difficult to keep track of constantly (not uncommon in crowded schools) could be tracked under the same general framework as exists in <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/rhode-island/2013/title-42/chapter-42-153/section-42-153-3">Rhode Island</a>; this tracking would take the form of an ID badge similar to that issued to normal students but with either a password-based turn-off system, or without the ability to be turned off. In the case where the system cannot be turned off, the ID card should not be allowed to leave the school, to avoid external entities from abusing it to gain useful data.</p>
