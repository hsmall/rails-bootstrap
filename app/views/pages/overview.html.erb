<h1>Overview of the Case</h1>

<p>During the 2012-2013 school year, two schools in San Antonio, Texas&#039; Northside Independent School District (ISD) instituted a pilot program in which RFID tags were used to monitor the location of students. The two schools, Jay High School and Jones Middle School, had a combined enrollment of 4,200 students, all of whom were required to carry ID cards with embedded RFID tags with them to school and throughout the school day. These ID cards were designed to transmit their location information to electronic RFID readers installed throughout both schools, allowing students to be located at any time. There were many reasons that for instating this pilot program was and they are best summarized by a statement made by the Northside ISD&#058;</p>

<p class="block-quote">&quot;Northside ISD is harnessing the power of radio frequency identification technology (RFID) to make schools safer, know where our students are while at school, increase revenues, and provide a general purpose &#039;smart&#039; ID card.&quot;</p>

<p>Examining the order of the above statement gives insight into the significance of each of the driving factors behind the program. Firstly, keeping students safe is, and always should be, the main priority of schools nationwide. In light of the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting and the more recent 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary shooting, school security has been brought into question, requiring school administrations to find new, effective, and efficient ways to ensure safety. The idea behind location monitoring is, if the school knows where all of the students are during an emergency, they can take the best actions to protect the largest number of students. Secondly, increasing revenues is an important part of maintaining and improving a school. In most counties in the U.S. public school funding is based largely on school attendance. By using RFID tags, a school can better record attendance by including all students on the premises instead of just those who show up to their homeroom class. This natrually leads to an increase in funding for the school, especially considering the relative inexpense of RFID tags. Finally, allocating a &quot;smart&quot; ID card with RFID tags to each student can help to make many other activities such as buying lunch from the cafeteria or checking out a book form the library easier.</p>

<p>However, there are a variety of concerns that arise with the use of RFID technology. Most significantly if student location information were to fall into the wrong hands. In general, RFID technology is not very secure, meaning that the RFID tags that the students would carry around would be vulnerable to be read by malicious individuals external to the school administration. Another, more political, opposition is that when students know their activity is being monitored they may be less likely to meet with a school counselor. Along these lines, there is the concern that conditioning children to being monitored will train them to accept breaches of privacy and civil liberties in the future.</p>

<p>It is clear that there are a fair amount of benefits and drawbacks to using RFID tags for this purpose. In order to develop our own policy recommendation, we examined this issue from both an ethical and a legal perspective.</p>
