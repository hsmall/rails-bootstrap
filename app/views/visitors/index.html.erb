<h1>RFID Tags in Schools</h1>
<p>A Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag is a small electronic device composed of a computer chip (typically carrying &lt; 2000 bytes of data) and a radio antenna. The predominant use of RFID tags in today’s world is to provide a unique identifier for the object to which it is attached. A major convenience of RFID tags is that, unlike barcodes or biometric identifiers, they can be read from up to 20 feet away, in any orientation. While RFID technology is nothing new, there has been a recent surge in its popularity due to the continually decreasing manufacturing costs, with today’s tags costing between 20¢ and 40¢. Essentially, RFID tags facilitate the identification and monitoring of a large number of objects at a fairly reasonable price and scale.</p>
<p>In recent years, the use of RFID technology has been extended to tracking the locations of people, most commonly children in schools. This practice raises a new set of ethical and policy issues. Does the government have the power and mandate to force children to wear RFID tags in schools? A utilitarian argument could be made that the efficiency gains made possible through automated roll-call and attendance tracking (often directly linked to school funding) outweigh individual students’ privacy concerns, especially when students are already more closely monitored in a school than they would be elsewhere. Another argument could be made that the social importance of raising children to be independent, self-reliant adults outweighs the other goals mentioned, and that the real-time tracking made possible through these systems would erode that goal.</p>
<p>Our project will explore these issues through the lens of the attempted implementation of RFID-enabled student monitoring in a San Antonio, Texas school district during 2012-2013.</p>
