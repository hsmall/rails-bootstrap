<h1>Ethical Considerations</h1>
	<p>The debate about RFID tags comes down to whether or not the benefits of tracking technology outweight the drawbacks. There are, however, many ways in which to quantify and evaluate the benefits and drawbacks. Some ethical frameworks, such as Deontology, focus on determining what is right and wrong and only doing what is right. Other frameworks, such as Utilitarianism, focus on calculating net benefit between courses of action and choosing the action with the greatest outcome. Below we examine the issue of RFID tags from the aforementioned frameworks.</p>

	<h3>Deontology (<a href="http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_deontology.html">Read More</a>)</h3>
	<p>From a deontological perspective, the only important decision to be made is whether monitoring with RFID tags is <i>right</i> or <i>wrong</i>. Thus, the only component of the case that needs to be addressed is the privacy violations. The communications director of the Northside ISD, Pascual Gonzalez, argues that there are no privacy rights for student and, as such, nothing wrong with encroaching upon student privacy:

	<p class="block-quote">&quot;By virtue of the fact that you are a student at a school, there is no privacy. [...] It is our responsibility to know where every single one of those 3,000 students are while they are in our care during the school day.&quot;</p>

	<p style="text-indent:0pt">Certainly there are rights which everyday citizens have which do not carry over to students since students are required, by law, to be in school. However, do students really have no privacy? As of now, students have the right to seek counseling and medical services in their schools. With RFID tags tracking their every move, students could easily be discouraged from utilizing these services for fear of judgement. While this is not a <i>denial</i> of student rights, it is a definite obstruction.</p>

	<p>Privacy advocates argue that schools have a moral responsibility to foster independence in their children, which constant monitoring may infringe.</p>

	<p class="block-quote">&quot;Teaching students at a young age to be cautious about whom they associate with, where they seek a quiet moment, and what student groups they join, lest they be remotely identified at the touch of a button, is a poor lesson for the future leaders of a democracy.&quot;</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent:0pt">The environment in which a child develops often has a profound affect on the future of the child. As such, encouraging responsibility and values of independence would be the right thing to do as it builds moral and desirable characteristics.</p>

	<h3>Utilitarianism (<a href="http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_utilitarianism.html">Read More</a>)</h3>
	<p>From a utilitarian perspective, the goal is to maximize the benefits of RFID tags (primarily safety) while minimizing the drawbacks (primarily privacy violation). But how can we quantify these qualities? It is impossible to verify complete safety, it is only possible to verify a lack of safety. As such, it is difficult to figure out how much safety would be added through the use of RFID tags, considering the relative infrequency of emergency situations. On the other hand the severity of privacy violation is also difficult to put a number on. What forms of privacy are more important than others? As we can see, the cost/benefit analysis is extremely difficult in this case.</p>

	<p>One of the primary utilitarian arguments for RFID tags in schools is that only <b>2 of the 4,200 students</b> are on record of having complained in any way about the program. If 99.95&#37; of the students were okay with the program, this is clearly the majority so the debate should be over, right? No, it is also important to calculate the total amount of benefit and harm the program caused the 4,200 students. While only 2 complained, there are no statistics or information on <i>how happy</i> the other 4,198 students were with the program. On the other hand, one could argue that at least 1 of the 2 students who complained had a very negative experience. One girl, who was devoutly religious, objected to wearing an RFID tag because she equated it with the &quot;mark of the beast&quot; from the Book of Revelation. To her, RFID tags were literally a sign of the ending of humanity, so it is quite possible that her negative experience outweighs the relatively neutral experiences of the rest of the student population and the other benefits (safety, monetary, etc.) to the school.</p>
